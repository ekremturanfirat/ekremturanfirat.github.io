                                Hi,
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                am Ekrem Turan Fırat. Let me briefly introduce myself. I am a first year (currently) student of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Although I graduated from a technical high school, I also have a maker background dating back to my middle school years. Right now, I am not a maker but an engineer candidate, and I am doing jobs that I think are nice.
                            </p>
                            <p>  
                                I don't want to explain my <a href="https://ekremturanfirat.com/cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV</a> to you here. You must have seen and examined it in the introduction, but let me briefly tell you. I am studying at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cumhuriyet.edu.tr/">Cumhuriyet University</a>. I will soon go to <a href="https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGH University of Science & Technology</a> in Poland for my education. I am also actively working as an Undergraduate Researcher at <a href="http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">METU Power Lab</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                Okay, that's enough CV :)
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                I am a young person who is trying to improve himself especially in power electronics and related hardware design. I opened this website to help those who want to improve themselves in this and similar fields like me (And a portfolio :))
                            </p>    
                            <p> 
                                I am not someone who hides what I know, especially in technical matters. On the contrary, I want to share it without applying any filters to help others. I know I am not an expert but as a student I have been interested in these for a very long time. I am trying to learn how to learn. I also have certain work experiences. I do not promise to give you information that will create wonders but I can help you on how to get started.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Here I want to share the information I have gained especially on PCB Design and Power Electronics with its sources. I want to touch on topics such as how to do a project, how to research, how to proceed, how to finalize. Here I will not try to share hearsay information like on some platforms. Frankly, I do not know if you will read it but I will do write when I find time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can always reach me about the mistakes I made or any other issue from my contact information on the homepage. I will try to get back to you within a few hours.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Best regards, see you in the next article.
